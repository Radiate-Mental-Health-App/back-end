Radiate is a web application dedicated to fostering mental well-being by providing users with essential tools to manage and improve their mental health. Empowering individuals to understand, express, and seek support, Radiate combines a mood tracker, journal writing, appointment booking with a licensed psychologist, and a chatbot.

Radiate also provides psychologist with the flexibility to add their schedules, check on the booked appointments, as well as a dashboard to help them organize their work.

Aside from the users and psychologists, Radiate is complemented with an admin-role feature to manage users, psychologists, and the chatbot.

Radiate is developed with the hope of helping people to be concerned and appreciate more about what they feel and what they have in mind, moreover, to encourage people to seek help from professionals for a better mental state and achieve peace.
